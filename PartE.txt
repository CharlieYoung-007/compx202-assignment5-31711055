1. What is a Fragment?
Fragment can be regarded as an active interface layout, which depends on activities,
but its activities and life cycle can improve the interface by replacing parts of activities.
2. How would using Fragments help in this situation?
For this assignment, I think we can create two fragments,
image fragment and text fragment. In this way, we can encapsulate our code
so as to reduce the time for us to rethink the design of landscape interface.
