1. What is a Fragment?
Fragment can be regarded as an active interface layout, which depends on activities,
but its activities and life cycle can improve the interface by replacing parts of activities.
Fragment featuresï¼š
    1.Fragment has its own life cycle;
    2.Individuals can receive input events, and they can add or remove fragments when activity is
      running;
    3.Fragment must be attached to the activity. For example: when activity is suspended, fragment
      need to be suspended and destruction is also destroyed;
    4.When the activity runs, individuals can operate each fragment independently, or they can
      communicate between fragment and activity;
How to use:
    Firstly, people can create a fragment class. Secondly, add fragment to activity layout. Thirdly,
    call this fragment in activity.
2. How would using Fragments help in this situation?
For this assignment, I think we can create two fragments,
image fragment and text fragment. In this way, we can encapsulate our code
so as to reduce the time for us to rethink the design of landscape interface.
